# Bid_Point
Multiple online platforms provide bidding services, but there exist loopholes that make users fall prey to scams. The web application ‘Bid Point’ provides an auction service that is user-friendly in terms of usability and security for both buyers and sellers. The website features security measures that make it stand out from existing platforms. Multiple stages of verifications will be implemented that will ensure the buyer and/or seller is legitimate. It also hosts an AI that checks the seller’s listing to see if the images are genuine or ripped from the internet. Combined with integration with payment services like PayPal and cloud storage services, the website will play the middleman (or the auction host) to both buyers and sellers.
